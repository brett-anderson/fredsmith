### My work from home workspace

I've been working at least partially remote since 2018 and fully remote since 
2020. Even after COVID, my current [job](https://www.untappd.com) is a fully 
remote situation, so my work-from-home setup needs to be really good.

In "work mode" the primary computer is a [2019 16" Macbook Pro](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP809?locale=en_US), hooked to an 
[Anker thunderbolt docking station](https://us.anker.com/products/a8396). This drives two external monitors, a
[50" Samsung 4K TV](https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/uhd-tvs/50--class-ru7100-smart-4k-uhd-tv--2019--un50ru7100fxza/) and a [Dell Ultrasharp 1600p monitor](https://www.dell.com/hr/business/p/dell-u3011/pd). This provides a massive amount of visible screen real estate. 

Audio is piped over HDMI to the Samsung TV, which is optically connected to a [192KHz DAC](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MPF4F68/) which drives a [Creative Pebble Plus 2.1](https://us.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-pebble-plus) speaker setup.  I additionally have a [Jabra Speak 710](https://www.jabra.com/business/speakerphones/jabra-speak-series/jabra-speak-710##7710-309) noise cancelling mic and speaker for Zoom meetings.

Input is taken care of with a [Kinesis Edge](https://gaming.kinesis-ergo.com/edge/) with [Cherry MX Brown](https://www.cherrymx.de/en/mx-original/mx-brown.html) switches. The [Anker Vertical Mouse](https://us.anker.com/collections/other/products/a7851) keeps my wrists happy.

My Desk is an [Ikea GERTON](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/gerton-tabletop-beech-50106773/) in Beech with 
[Vivo dual motor standing desk legs](https://www.vivo-us.com/products/desk-v120eb-br-br-electric-dual-motor-desk-frame). Additionally, two [VIVO VESA desk mounts](https://www.vivo-us.com/collections/monitor-mounts/products/stand-v001) hold up the monitors.
